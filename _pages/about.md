About me
======
I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year Ph.D student at Information Sciences and Technology (IST) department, Pennsylvania State University. My research are focusing on machine learning. Currently I am insterested in Large Language Model (LLM) and Graph Neural Network (GNN). I got my M.S. degree from The Ohio State University and got my B.S. degree from Clemson University, both major in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). I am proud of being an Ohio buckeyes and a Clemson Tigers!
